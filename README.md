# My-Projects
This repository is made to hold all my personal learning projects

I have created a file called first.py which contains a warm up of basics in python like Variables,Data types,Type conversion (int, float), Arithmetic, Formatted printing,String concatenation, Basic logic thinking. 

This will help me to proceed in pyhton and ready for advanced python for data sciences.

can't wait what all new skills i'll gain.

Today i proceeded to the next one called second.py, this one contains the loop logic and conditional statements. i used a challenge  of opening a vault in three levels and if all passed successfully then the vault opens.

in the third fie, u'll also find another task which uses Lists
Tuples,Dictionaries,Looping through data structures,Function,Parameters,Return values. 

lastly, i now combined all into a one simple banking system project which combines all these fields to become effectively functioning system.
